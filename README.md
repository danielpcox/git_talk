Getting Git
===========

These are the slides for a talk I gave on Git to my coworkers at Six3 Systems.

## Acknowledgements

My talk is based on Scott Chacon's talk with the same title, which remains the
best talk on Git I have ever seen. About half of my slides from from various
[talks by Chacon](https://github.com/schacon/git-presentations), and I owe him
tremendously for all of his work.

Thanks also go to Six3 Systems, for allowing me to post this publicly.
